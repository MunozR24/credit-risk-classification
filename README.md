# Loan Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate various machine learning models for predicting the financial outcomes of loans based on historical stock data. The primary goal is to predict whether a loan is healthy (`0`) or high-risk (`1`) using historical financial metrics.

## Analysis Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to:
- Assess the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting loan statuses.
- Identify the key financial features that influence loan outcomes.
- Incorporation of additional features and more sophisticated feature engineering techniques might enhance predictive accuracy.

## Usage

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the analysis scripts in the appropriate order.

Happy analyzing! ðŸ“Š
